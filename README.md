# ccat_holo

CCAT_holo is a python package which is designed to analyze the holographic measurement data for the Fred Young Sub-mm Telescope. The telescope uses a special 'Crossed-Dragone' optics design, which consists of two 6-m reflectors. Its two reflectors both have to be aligned to be better than 10um (goal of < 7um). 

A new holographic metrology, **'Multi-map'** Holography method, has been developed to measure and discriminate the surface errors between the two reflectors by taking 5 complex beam maps of the telescope. 'CCAT_holo' software is developed to convert the measured beam maps into the 'Two' surface error maps of the telescope.
