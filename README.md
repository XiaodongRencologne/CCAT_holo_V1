# ccat_holo

CCAT_holo is a python package which is designed to analyze the holographic measurement data for the Fred Young Sub-mm Telescope. The telescopo uses 'Crossed-Dragone' optical design and consists of two 6-m reflectors. The surface deviations of the two reflectors needs to be measured and aligned to be better than 10um (goal of <7um). A new holographic metrology, named 'Multi-map' holography method, has been developed to simultenously measure the surface errors of the two reflectors by measuring 5 complex beam maps of the telescope. The CCAT_holo software offers the way to extract the reflector surfaces from the measured beams.
