# ccat_holo

'ccat_holo' is a python package which is designed to analyze the holographic measurement data for the Fred Young Sub-mm Telescope. The telescope uses a special 'Crossed-Dragone' optics design, which consists of two 6-m reflectors. Its two reflectors both have to be aligned to be better than 10um (goal of < 7um). 

The new **'Multi-map'** Holography method has been developed for measuring and discriminating the surface errors of the two reflectors of FYST by taking 5 different beam maps. The software was developed for the data analysis which can convert the 5 measured beam maps into 'Two' surface error maps.

## Installation
**This package just works with python3.**

Following packages are required:
1. numpy v1.21
2. scipy v1.7
3. pytorch 1.12
4. transforms3d v0.4.1
5. h5py v3.6.0
6. pyvista

You can install these packages using the command:

'pip install -r requirements'

When you have all required packages, you can clone or download the 'ccat_holo' repository from github or uni-koeln gitlab. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/XiaodongRencologne/CCAT_holo_V1.git
'''
or
'''shell
git clone https://github.com/XiaodongRencologne/CCAT_holo_V1.git
```

## FYST Geometry
The files in the folder 'CCAT_folder' is used to set the FYST telescope's geometry, operating frequency and the beam pattern of the holo-Rx. 

** Electrical Setting **

For the FYST holographic experiment, you do not need to change any settings. Maybe only the electrical parameters given in the file of 'electrical_parameter.txt' need to be changed based on the practical experiments.

'electrical_parameter.txt'
freq/GHz, 296  # GHz

Edge_taper, -8 # dB

taper_angle, 11.893

Here, you can set the operating frequency and the illumination edge taper and taper angle which is related to the Guassian beam pattern of the holographic receiver. 

** Panel Size, adjuster positions, and Sampling Number **

These are defined in the 'input.txt' file.

## Coordinate systems

FYST holography meausrement will measure 5 beam maps by puting the Rx at 5 different points. The coordinates of the 5 Rx moutning points and the cooresponding scan path must be expressed in the 'coord_Rx' and 'coord_Scan' coordinate systems shown in below figure.


The field points defined by the real telescope rotation axes must be converted to the coordinates
