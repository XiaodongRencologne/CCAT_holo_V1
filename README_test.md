# ccat_holo

'ccat_holo' is a python package which is designed to analyze the holographic measurement data for the Fred Young Sub-mm Telescope. The telescope uses a special 'Crossed-Dragone' optics design, which consists of two 6-m reflectors. Its two reflectors both have to be aligned to be better than 10um (goal of < 7um). 

The new **'Multi-map'** Holography method has been developed for measuring and discriminating the surface errors of the two reflectors of FYST by taking 5 different beam maps. The software was developed for the data analysis which can convert the 5 measured beam maps into 'Two' surface error maps.

## Installation
**This package just works with python3.**

Following packages are required:
1. numpy v1.21
2. scipy v1.7
3. pytorch 1.12
4. transforms3d v0.4.1
5. h5py v3.6.0
6. pyvista

You can install these packages using the command:

'pip install -r requirements'

When you have all required packages, you can clone or download the 'ccat_holo' repository from github or uni-koeln gitlab. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/XiaodongRencologne/CCAT_holo_V1.git
or
git clone https://github.com/XiaodongRencologne/CCAT_holo_V1.git

# the data produced by the First beam calculations. Here, we can use the movements
# of the panel adjusters or coefficients of Zernike polynomial as the fitting paramters.
# If fitting_param is 'zernike', the surface deviations will be described by 
# the summation of zernike polynimals, and the maximum zernike order is 7th.
